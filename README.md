# My personal nixos configuration
This is just the nixos configuration that I use, and is public so that I can clone the repo without dealing with github authentication.

## Bash scripts
### Reload
    Fetch the lastest config from git and build it.
### Rebuid
    Open /etc/nixos/configuration.nix in neovim for editing, lint with alejandra, and then rebuild the system from the updated config.
### Edit
    Open /etc/nixos/configuration.nix in neovim for editing.
